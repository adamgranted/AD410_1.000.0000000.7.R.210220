# Amcrest AD410 Firmware v1.000.0000000.7.R.210220
This is the last working Amcrest AD410 firmware for me using Scrypted. You can use this if you've updated to a newer, breaking version.

In the event they disable the [official download link](https://amcrest-firmwares.s3.amazonaws.com/Lexus_SDB61i-Lexus2_Eng_N_32M_nonCA_V1.000.0000000.7.R.20210220.bin), I wanted to have a backup for those running into the same issue.

Using the Amcrest IP App on OSX or Windows, connect to your camera and use the Upgrade tab. Select this firmware and push to the device.
